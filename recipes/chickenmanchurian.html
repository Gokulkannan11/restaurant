    <p>A simple and savory dish with an element of freshness delivered by the fragrant and flavorful cilantro. Serve immediately over white rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons corn flour</li>

    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat egg in a large bowl. Mix all-purpose flour and 1 1/2 tablespoons corn flour into egg until batter is smooth; season with salt and pepper. Dip chicken into batter, working in batches, until coated; place on a plate in a single layer so the pieces do not touch.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium-high heat; add enough vegetable oil to reach about 1/2-inch depth. Fry battered chicken, working in batches, in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken, using a slotted spoon, to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Mix chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and monosodium glutamate into garlic-ginger mixture; cook and stir until sauce is heated through, about 5 minutes. Add green bell pepper to sauce and cook until slightly tender, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk water and 2 tablespoons corn flour together in a bowl until smooth; stir into sauce until incorporated. Bring sauce to a boil. Add chicken and stir to coat.</li>
    </ol>
